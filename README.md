# Image-Processing
This repository contains source codes created for my Image Processing class provided UNIDEB.

NB!
The source codes are in a Visual Studio project, every class in a seperated .cpp file.
I upload these source codes commented, because it's much easier for me to seperate key conceptions.
You should have only one main() function uncommented, otherwise your program won't run.
Every key conception is in a different commented block.

To run these codes, you will need to have OpenCV on your machine: https://opencv.org/
